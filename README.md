# Data-Wrangining-World-Bank-Project-JSON

This Project aims at working with the data sets of World bank (world_bank_projects.json) in order to solve three queries such as:  

1. Find the 10 countries with most projects 
2. Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode') 
3. In point 2 above, there are some entries that have only the code and the name is missing. Create a DataFrame with the missing names filled in.
